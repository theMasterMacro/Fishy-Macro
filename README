heres how to set it up:
1: You can Download the FishyMacro in the release tab on the right side
2: after FishyMacro is done installing, unzip the folder and open FishyMacro
3: you will be met with a decent tkinter GUI with different tabs and a seperate txt file called "stuck on something? open for help" if you are having any trouble on setting the macro up
4: choose the rod you have in the "Rod Type" settings and put Detection speed to 100-350 (more fps = more CPU usage)    LOW end = 80-100, MID end = 100-200, High end = 200-1000 
5: on the Automation tab there isnt much to explain and everything is self explanatory
6: go to fish and activate the macro
